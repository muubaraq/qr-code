### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstap.com/) for responsive design



### What I learned

Centering A div is always a good idea. hahaha.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<p class="card text-danger">I'm using a bootstrap class to make this text red</p>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: hotpink;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```




### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - This helped me for responsiveness. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://mdbootstrap.com/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand some components and thier uses in bootstrap. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
